            <em>Ahhh just like Grandma used to make</em>(We all know that Grandma was
            and always will be a top chef.) Reminisce about the good old days
            of being babysat at granny's trailer park. She did gather all she 
            had left in her pantry, but <em>she added her love dammit</em>!
            </p>

            Such a simple recipe for anyone to make! Only a couple ingredients
            to send your mouth and stomach in to <strong>overdrive</strong>.
